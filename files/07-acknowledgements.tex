I am deeply grateful to my supervisor, Marcus Pearce, for his unwavering support and patience, and for always making the time to provide thoughtful advice. I am also thankful for the endless guidance offered by Emmanouil Benetos, and for the feedback from Bob Sturm, Elaine Chew, and Mathieu Barthet, the other members of my progression panel. I am indebted to Peter Harrison and Ana Clemente for their help and suggestions, and to the other members of the Music Cognition Lab for promoting high standards of critical thinking and scientific integrity, and providing countless opportunities for stimulating discussion. I would like to acknowledge the support offered by the Cognitive Science Research Group and the Centre for Digital Music, as well as the Media and Arts Technology programme and its staff---Jonathan Winfield in particular, who facilitated much of my work. I am also grateful to the open-source communities behind the multiple software tools on which the present research depended. Finally, I would like to thank Hannah for being profoundly encouraging and kind throughout my doctoral studies.
